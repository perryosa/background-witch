# Background and Shadow generation via AI -- bgenie-GAN

I have developed bgenie-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network that works like magic and is capable of placing your car from road to shining showroom in just one click. It is a novel approach and have not yet published anywhere else up till date.

# Work in Progress

Due to lack of data our model still does not give perfect result for all the camera angles. With further processing and improvement in our network architecture we are aiming to make it more robust to change.
